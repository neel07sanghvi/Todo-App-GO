## Installation

1. Clone or create the project:
```bash
mkdir todo-cli
cd todo-cli
```

2. Initialize the Go module:
```bash
go mod init github.com/yourusername/todo-cli
```

3. Create the folder structure and add the files as shown above.

```

## Usage

### Available Commands

- `add <task>` - Add a new todo item
- `list` - List all todo items
- `update <id> <new_task>` - Update an existing todo item
- `delete <id>` - Delete a todo item
- `complete <id>` - Mark a todo item as completed

### Examples

```bash
> add Buy groceries
Todo added with ID: 1

> add Call dentist
Todo added with ID: 2

> list
=== Your Todos ===
1. [ ] Buy groceries (created: 2024-01-15 10:30)
2. [ ] Call dentist (created: 2024-01-15 10:31)

Total: 2 | Completed: 0 | Remaining: 2

> complete 1
Todo with ID 1 marked as completed

> update 2 Schedule dentist appointment
Todo with ID 2 updated successfully

> list
=== Your Todos ===
1. [✓] Buy groceries (created: 2024-01-15 10:30) (completed: 2024-01-15 10:32)
2. [ ] Schedule dentist appointment (created: 2024-01-15 10:31)

Total: 2 | Completed: 1 | Remaining: 1

> delete 1
Todo with ID 1 deleted successfully
```

## Architecture

The application is structured with separation of concerns:

- **main.go**: Handles user input and CLI interface
- **help.go**: Contains help functionality
- **internal/todo/model.go**: Defines the Todo data structure
- **internal/todo/manager.go**: Implements business logic for managing todos

### Key Components

1. **Todo Model**: Represents individual todo items with ID, task, completion status, and timestamps
2. **TodoManager**: Manages the collection of todos with CRUD operations
3. **CLI Interface**: Interactive command-line interface for user interaction

## Data Storage

Currently, all data is stored in memory using Go maps and slices. Data will be lost when the application exits. This is intentional for the basic version - no database or file persistence is implemented.

## Future Enhancements

- File-based persistence (JSON/YAML)
- Database integration
- Priority levels for todos
- Due dates and reminders
- Categories and tags
- Search and filter functionality
- Export/import features
